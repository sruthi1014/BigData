<h3>1) Introduction</h3></br>
<h3>2) Logistic Regression</h3></br>
<h3>3) Neural Net Classifier</h3></br>
   </br>
<h3>4) Results</h3></br>   Logistic regression model resulted in a 91% accuracy in predicting the hand drawn digit images. The test accuracy has increased from 91% to 97% when CNN model was implemented. </br></br>
<h3>5) Data Source</h3></br>The dataset has been taken from a kaggle competition. The below link can be used to get the test and train datasets which were used in this project.
