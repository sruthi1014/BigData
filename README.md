4) Results</br>
   Logistic regression model resulted in a 91% accuracy in predicting the hand drawn digit images. Accuracy has increased from 91% to 97% when CNN model was implemented. </br></br>
5) Data Source</br>
 The dataset has been taken from a kaggle competition. The below link can be used to get the test and train datasets which were used in this project.
